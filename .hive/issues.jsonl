{"id":"opencode-swarm-monorepo-lf2p4u-mjd40ednk3b","title":"Auto-sync hive at key events","description":"Add automatic JSONL sync at strategic points to prevent cells from being lost when processes exit unexpectedly.\n\n## Changes\n1. `hive_create_epic` - sync after creating epic + subtasks (so workers can see them)\n2. `swarm_complete` - sync before worker exits (persist their work)\n3. Process exit hook - safety net via `process.on('beforeExit')` in hive.ts module init\n\n## Context\n- Lazy write pattern is intentional (mark dirty → explicit flush)\n- These auto-syncs are strategic checkpoints, not replacing manual sync\n- Sync is idempotent - no-op if nothing dirty\n\n## TDD Required\n- Test that hive_create_epic syncs (mock adapter.syncToJsonl)\n- Test that swarm_complete syncs\n- Test process exit hook registration","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-19T16:54:31.883Z","updated_at":"2025-12-19T16:54:31.883Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
