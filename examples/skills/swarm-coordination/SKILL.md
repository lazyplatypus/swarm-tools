# Swarm Coordination Skill

This skill provides guidance for effective multi-agent coordination in OpenCode swarm workflows.

## When to Use Swarm Coordination

Use swarm coordination when:
- A task has multiple independent subtasks that can run in parallel
- The task requires different specializations (e.g., frontend + backend + tests)
- Work can be divided by file/module boundaries
- Time-to-completion matters and parallelization helps

Do NOT use swarm coordination when:
- The task is simple and can be done by one agent
- Subtasks have heavy dependencies on each other
- The overhead of coordination exceeds the benefit

## Task Decomposition Strategy

### 1. Analyze the Task

Before decomposing, understand:
- What are the distinct units of work?
- Which parts can run in parallel vs sequentially?
- What are the file/module boundaries?
- Are there shared resources that need coordination?

### 2. Choose a Decomposition Strategy

**Parallel Strategy** - For independent subtasks:
```
Parent Task: "Add user authentication"
├── Subtask 1: "Create auth API endpoints" (backend)
├── Subtask 2: "Build login/signup forms" (frontend)
├── Subtask 3: "Write auth integration tests" (testing)
└── Subtask 4: "Add auth documentation" (docs)
```

**Sequential Strategy** - When order matters:
```
Parent Task: "Migrate database schema"
├── Step 1: "Create migration files"
├── Step 2: "Update model definitions"
├── Step 3: "Run migrations"
└── Step 4: "Verify data integrity"
```

**Hybrid Strategy** - Mixed dependencies:
```
Parent Task: "Add feature X"
├── Phase 1 (parallel):
│   ├── Subtask A: "Design API"
│   └── Subtask B: "Design UI mockups"
├── Phase 2 (sequential, after Phase 1):
│   └── Subtask C: "Implement based on designs"
└── Phase 3 (parallel):
    ├── Subtask D: "Write tests"
    └── Subtask E: "Update docs"
```

## File Reservation Protocol

When multiple agents work on the same codebase:

1. **Reserve files before editing** - Use `agentmail_reserve` to claim files
2. **Respect reservations** - Don't edit files reserved by other agents
3. **Release when done** - Files auto-release on task completion
4. **Coordinate on shared files** - If you must edit a reserved file, send a message to the owning agent

## Communication Patterns

### Broadcasting Updates
```
agentmail_send(recipients: ["all"], message: "Completed API endpoints, ready for frontend integration")
```

### Direct Coordination
```
agentmail_send(recipients: ["frontend-agent"], message: "Auth API is at /api/auth/*, here's the spec...")
```

### Blocking on Dependencies
```
# Wait for a dependency before proceeding
agentmail_receive(wait: true, filter: "api-complete")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Small, focused subtasks** - Each subtask should be completable in one agent session
2. **Clear boundaries** - Define exactly what files/modules each subtask touches
3. **Explicit handoffs** - When one task enables another, communicate clearly
4. **Graceful failures** - If a subtask fails, don't block the whole swarm
5. **Progress updates** - Use beads to track subtask status

## Common Patterns

### Feature Development
```yaml
decomposition:
  strategy: hybrid
  phases:
    - name: design
      parallel: true
      subtasks: [api-design, ui-design]
    - name: implement
      parallel: true
      subtasks: [backend, frontend]
    - name: validate
      parallel: true
      subtasks: [tests, docs, review]
```

### Bug Fix Swarm
```yaml
decomposition:
  strategy: sequential
  subtasks:
    - reproduce-bug
    - identify-root-cause
    - implement-fix
    - add-regression-test
```

### Refactoring
```yaml
decomposition:
  strategy: parallel
  subtasks:
    - refactor-module-a
    - refactor-module-b
    - update-imports
    - run-full-test-suite
```
