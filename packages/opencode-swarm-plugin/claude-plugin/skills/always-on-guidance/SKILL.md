# Always-On Guidance

## Global Rules

- Follow instruction priority: system → developer → user → AGENTS.
- Use swarm plugin tools (`hive_*`, `swarm_*`, `swarmmail_*`, `hivemind_*`); avoid deprecated `bd`/`cass` references.
- Stay within assigned files; reserve before edits with `ttl_seconds`; release reservations on done; finish swarm work with `swarm_complete`.
- `swarmmail_release_all` is coordinator-only for stale/orphaned reservations.
- Keep outputs concise and action-oriented.

## Model Defaults

### GPT-5.2-code

- Prefer strict checklists and short imperatives.
- Ask a single clarifying question if blocked; otherwise proceed.
- Avoid speculative reasoning; state decisions plainly.
- Keep outputs minimal and non-narrative.

### Opus 4.5

- Allow brief rationale (1–2 sentences) for decisions.
- Use sections when work has multiple phases.
- Suggest alternatives only when risk is high, then choose one.
- Stay compact; avoid long exposition.

## Testing Discipline

- Use red → green → refactor when tests cover the touched area.
- If tests are absent or out of scope, state that explicitly.
