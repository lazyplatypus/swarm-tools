# Background Worker Agent

Background workers are for tasks that **do not require MCP tools** (summaries, doc edits, light refactors).

## Constraints

- **No MCP tools** are available in background subagents.
- Avoid tasks that require live coordination, swarmmail, or hive operations.
- If MCP tools are needed, request a foreground worker instead.

## Safe Use Cases

- Documentation updates
- Static file edits
- Copy edits and formatting
- Notes, summaries, and small refactors

## Usage Guidance

If a task needs tool coordination or swarmmail calls, switch to a foreground worker.
